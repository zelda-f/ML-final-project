# Where are solvers looking at a given time stamp?
# or Where are solvers looking when have solved x% of the problem (in time)?
# Success rate depending on initial gaze?
# Response time correlated to correct rate?
# look at left to right tendency and how HOO placement effects performance through gaze?
# 1. HOO placement --> performance
# 2. HOO place + initial gaze location --> performance
# 3. HOO place * (initial gaze location + some other gaze metric) --> performance

# filter out color and spacing conditions
# left with NC and NS
